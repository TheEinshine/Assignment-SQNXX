Abhi's Web Application is a web application that uses React for the front end and a Node.js and Express.js server for the backend. The application is built to provide CRUD functionality for some kind of data, and it integrates with Firebase for authentication and storage. Here's an overview of the different components of the application:

Frontend The frontend of Einshine is a React application that uses the Vite build tool. The application includes the following dependencies:

firebase: The official Firebase SDK for JavaScript. react and react-dom: The core React libraries for building UI components. react-intersection-observer: A library for tracking when components enter or exit the viewport. react-router-dom: A library for building client-side routing in React applications. scroll-wrapper: A library for adding custom scrollbars to web pages. Scripts The following scripts are available in the package.json file for building and running the frontend:

dev: Starts the development server using Vite. build: Builds the production-ready assets for the frontend. preview: Builds and previews the production-ready assets for the frontend. Backend The backend of Einshine is a Node.js and Express.js server that provides APIs for handling CRUD operations. The server includes the following dependencies:

cors: A middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. dotenv: A library for loading environment variables from a .env file. express: A minimalist web framework for Node.js. mongoose: A library for connecting to MongoDB and modeling the data. nodemon: A utility for automatically restarting the server during development. Scripts The following scripts are available in the package.json file for running the backend:

test: A script for running unit tests. serve: Starts the server using Nodemon. Deployment To deploy the Einshine application, you'll need to follow these steps:

Build the production-ready assets for the front end using the build script. Serve the frontend assets and the backend API from a web server such as NGINX or Apache. Configure the server to load environment variables from a .env file containing the Firebase configuration. Make sure that the MongoDB database is up and running and that the MONGODB_URI environment variable is set correctly in the .env file. And that's it! With these steps completed, your Einshine application should be fully functional and ready for use.
